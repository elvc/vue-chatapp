# Chat App (Vue, FireBase, Google Cloud Functions, Netlify)

## Story
This app is written in Vue, SCSS, Firebase and Google Cloud Functions, a public chatroom that after the user is logged in with their Google account, they would be able to chat with anyone in the chatroom. The chatroom will show who's online or offline in real-time as well.

This desktop app was created as my first journey to learn Vue.js, Vuex, Vue Router, Firebase, and Google Cloud Functions (and Serverless). The first working version was done less than a week for experimental purposes and feed my thirst for learning Vue.

Again, this is intended to be used on a desktop/laptop device. Don't be surprise if this is not responsive on mobile. This is intentional due to time constraints. I may create an mobile version some time in the future.

Although you can run the app locally, you need to set up your own: Firebase, Google Cloud Functions and also env variables to be consumed by this app.

Therefore, I recommend checking out the code but see the demo via this link:
